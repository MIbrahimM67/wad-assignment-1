                    In today's Information Society, expertise in all forms of information is required for progress in
                    science, business, and education. The main aim of MS programme in Information Science & Technology
                    (IST) is to design and develop information related applications using information technology by
                    understanding relationship between digital information, people and technology. The MS programme
                    intends to bring together Computer Science and collaborative environment of how people and society
                    interact with digital information MS (Information Science & Technology) Part Time (with 6 credit
                    hours per semester) M.Sc.(Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Technology) or 4 years
                    BS (Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Technology) with experience in digital
                    information management.

                    Data Science has become an important due to the need for analyzing and understanding ever increasing
                    data generated by a multitude of sources. By getting admission in the MS programme applicants will
                    not only improve their qualifications but will also be equipped with the latest knowledge in the
                    field. The students will be exposed to different aspects of data science including programming, data
                    structures, and algorithms for data science, data analysis and visualization, and big data
                    analytics. These aspects will provide the students the opportunities to effectively work in local
                    and international markets as well as to pursue a PhD degree in data science.

                <p>
                    The BS Computer Science program at QAU provides a well-integrated balance of theoretical and
                    practical knowledge required for developing reliable and usable software tools for different fields.
                    The program enables students to design, implement and manage systems combining scientific,
                    computational, communication and multimedia facilities in different domains. The main objective of
                    the program is to provide students with a balanced breadth and depth of knowledge in Computer
                    Science that enables them to begin their professional career in the software industry or they can
                    continue their education at graduate level. In the final three semesters, students enhance their
                    skills and knowledge in one of the following focus areas:
